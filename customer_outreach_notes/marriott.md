## Notes

### 2025-01-26 | Account Team

**Context**: Weekly outreach on revenue moves

**Move Observed**: CALL (29.5%), Unistore (28.2%), Iceberg DML (18.4%)

**Account Team Response**: "We're tracking and investigating the usage. We're working directly with the unistore team to isolate the usage. We also replied to an iceberg related inquiry due to increased usage. On iceberg, we expect this usage to decrease as they won't have a need for managed tables / the external tool that was hitting them. That data will be brought back into Snowflake. They are doing some testing with this and that's the reason for the spike as far as we're concerned. For CALL, there has been a significant increase in cloud services credits consumed due to excessive SPROC calls and we are working to remediate this immediately with the customer. This will be rearchitected and cloud services credits reduced."
