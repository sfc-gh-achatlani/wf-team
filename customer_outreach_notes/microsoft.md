## Notes

### 2025-01-19 | Account Team

**Context**: Weekly outreach on revenue moves

**Move Observed**: SLP jump

**Account Team Response**: "Hello! Yes intentional. They're using us for reinforcement learning and pump out a ton of data regularly for experiments / training. After investigating that data, they don't typically revisit it much. For speed, they haven't been doing any storage management and the data has just been piling up since they initially implemented about a year ago. Because they're on Azure, this wasn't available to them and is currently in PrPr. We gave them access and they immediately turned it on to reduce storage costs going forward"
