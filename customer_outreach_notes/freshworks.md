## Notes

### 2024-12-08 | Account Team

**Context**: Weekly outreach on revenue moves (Analytics)

**Move Observed**: Spike last week but drop below baseline

**Account Team Response**: "C-Suite cost savings mandate leading to exploration of E6(Delta Lake) combo. Two paths in Jan, prove that cost savings can happen on Snowflake (gen 2) or prove that Iceberg/Delta Direct is the only way to reliably use data stored on DBX as E6 is having trouble with stability as they run 15+M queries a day"
