**Move Observed**: Bump in Collab on platform monetized apps - has Observe recently purchased any apps through the Marketplace?

**Account Team Response**: "A&C: They recently bought iPinfo through the marketplace. PbA: After they onboard a lot of clients they are constantly fine tuning their workloads to optimized for spend. This is a constant cycle with them if you look back on historical spend and growth. Cortex: No this was not accidental. This was planned as they are continuing to release their investigation tool to more and more clients"
