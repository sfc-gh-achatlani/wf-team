## Notes

### 2024-10-20 | Account Team

**Context**: Weekly outreach on revenue moves

**Move Observed**: Two week ago spike in DE tools coming down

**Account Team Response**: "Datavant's compute usage appears spiky because of the nature of their workload. They handle HIPAA PHI data processing for their customers, which involves tokenizing PHI information and running match-and-assess processes across multiple datasets — often between datasets from different customers. When Datavant sells a large data project, they typically spin up a 4XL warehouse and process data continuously throughout the day, consuming anywhere from 1,000 to 3,000 credits daily. The significant usage spikes you see on 10/21 and 7/31 correspond to those larger processing events. The more frequent pattern involves smaller dataset processing — typically in the 500–1,000 credit range — that create moderate spikes but are less noticeable in isolation."
