## Notes

### 2024-10-13 | Account Team

**Context**: Weekly outreach on revenue moves (DE, Analytics)

**Move Observed**: Overall up 12%, UNLOAD up 200%, TASK, Steam Access, DE Tools all up

**Account Team Response**: "The unload pick up is an existing AI/ML enabler workload where we export training datasets back to S3 for Canva to build models on top of using Anyscale+PyTorch. There was a pause after the initial dev work was completed and then it was migrated to the production team to take it forward. That said this dataset is growing and we're planning to uplift it to Snowflake-managed Iceberg"
