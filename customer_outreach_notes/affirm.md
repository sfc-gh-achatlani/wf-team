## Notes

### 2024-12-08 | Account Team

**Context**: Weekly outreach on revenue moves (DE)

**Move Observed**: DE tools transformation spike last week, Apps and Collab also have interesting trend ups and crash

**Account Team Response**: "we noticed this as well. Black Friday Cyber Monday is Affirm's biggest event of the year as Amazon is one of their largest BNPL customers so the spike last week was very much related to the activity from Black Friday purchases. If you look at their consumption pre Black Friday their current run rate is still slightly above that and increasing steadily. We do expect to see a potential plateau or even a decline as they continue to heavily leverage Iceberg/Polaris, but are also actively working on growing our AI footprint with Snowflake Intelligence and AI Extract, and starting Spark Connect and Snowpark conversations once our new Notebooks are released in Jan."
