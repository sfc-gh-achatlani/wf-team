### 2024-10-20 | Account Team

**Context**: Weekly outreach on revenue moves

**Move Observed**: DML increase and Snowflake ML and SPCS

**Account Team Response**: "The hypothesis for DE/DML spikes is that as more data comes in from disparate sources Videoamp has to parse through this to sell it. They have an ML use case going live in november that is called 'lift' it is a outcome measurement model (Exactly! Agencies, advertisers, Publishers like Paramount who want to show their advertisers that the media they buy is driving outcomes). Utilizes alot of advanced ML features like, Container runtime, Ml jobs, Distributed HPO, GPU's)"
