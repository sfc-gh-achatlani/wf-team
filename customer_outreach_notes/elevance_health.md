## Notes

### 2025-01-26 | Account Team

**Context**: Weekly outreach on revenue moves

**Move Observed**: Up 49% WoW, largely DML

**Account Team Response**: "The spike last week was due to a new warehouse configuration test they have been performing for one of their largest applications. That application has a monthly load and they ran it in parallel in both UAT and PROD which generated the spike. We don't expect the usage to be repeated in February."

### 2025-01-19 | Account Team

**Context**: Weekly outreach on revenue moves (DE)

**Move Observed**: Nothing super notable but top account + top gainer

**Account Team Response**: "From a DE perspective, specifically DML, this looks like well within typical volatility for the account and a rebound from a slow last few weeks. Does not seem worthwhile to reach out"

### 2024-10-13 | Account Team

**Context**: Weekly outreach on revenue moves (DE, Analytics)

**Move Observed**: No specific move noted

**Account Team Response**: "There are more data engineering workloads going live for the Hadoop migration and they are doing parallel runs in UAT until the end of the month. That is likely the reason for the continued uptick. The other two anomalous use cases have also not been fully addressed yet."

**Context**: Weekly outreach on revenue moves (DE)

**Move Observed**: -12.9% W/W, Come down from uptick last week that was testing new configurations

### 2024-09-22 | Account Team

**Context**: Weekly outreach on revenue moves (DE)

**Move Observed**: DML up 114%, ~$60K, double the size of usual spike

**Account Team Response**: "The uptick was primarily due to two existing applications testing alternative configurations/architecture patterns which we would consider an anomaly/temporary. However, there was increased consumption from Hadoop workloads starting to go live and a few other small use cases going live."
