## Notes

### 2025-01-26 | Account Team

**Context**: Weekly outreach on revenue moves

**Move Observed**: DML (78.1%), SELECT (5.9%)

**Account Team Response**: "This is a backfill that should not happen again any time soon. this was a mistake on EDO's side that needed to be corrected they are not planning on having this happen again. Please do let me know if you need anymore information, but this is an anomaly and should not be expected moving forward. I just had lunch with their head of infrastructure and this was confirmed. Thank you for reaching out and we are here to help color in anything you might need."
