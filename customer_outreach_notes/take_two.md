### 2024-10-06 | Account Team

**Context**: Weekly outreach on revenue moves (DE)

**Move Observed**: -29.5% W/W, down -67% on DE tools, -29.3% on DML, -25.8 Task

**Account Team Response**: "The recent uptick in consumption was all due to a new gaming release, NBA2K 26. They were giving insights and reports to execs and personas at T2 during the release. But now that the gaming release is over the consumption is coming down which is what youre seeing now"
