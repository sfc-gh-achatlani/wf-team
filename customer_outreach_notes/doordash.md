## Notes

### 2025-01-26 | Account Team

**Context**: Weekly outreach on revenue moves

**Move Observed**: Nothing super notable but top account + top contractor

**Account Team Response**: "Does not look like anything major in Data Engineering from a trends perspective. Broader call out that as DML slowly declines over time, Iceberg DML grows commensurate to the decline"

**Context**: Weekly outreach on revenue moves (DE)

**Move Observed**: +2.4% W/W, DML and Iceberg DML have been increasing steadily, Interoperable revenue is +10.8% and +$17K

**Account Team Response**: "Doordash has begun its Iceberg migration; it was described as 18PB over multiple months, primarily to unmanaged Iceberg. This growth seems in line with expectations."
