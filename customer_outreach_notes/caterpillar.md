## Notes

### 2024-09-29 | Account Team

**Context**: Weekly outreach on revenue moves (DE)

**Move Observed**: Down (8.6%) and $20K W/W in DE, looks like Task volatility, more interested in confirming whether the last few weeks of elevated Task revenue are related to Spark migrations

**Account Team Response**: "Atypical reloads for the warehouse [Teradata] which was doing more data loading recently as compared to historical. Caterpillar indicated a few weeks ago this was temporary to fix a data issue"
