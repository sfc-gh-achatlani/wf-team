## Notes

### 2024-09-29 | Account Team

**Context**: Weekly outreach on revenue moves (DE, Apps and Collab)

**Move Observed**: +4.6% W/W, mainly DML; +$74K and 13.4% W/W in DE; Down -$60K to $6K/W in Apps and Collab

**Account Team Response**: "Growth is in part driven by a new workload that has gone live, a customer-facing analytics app. More to do with very large Provider DML spike the last 2 weeks; account team unable to get visibility there"
