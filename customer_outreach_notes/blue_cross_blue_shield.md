## Notes

### 2025-01-19 | Account Team

**Context**: Weekly outreach on revenue moves

**Move Observed**: Random DML spikes

**Account Team Response**: "We are well-acquainted with the HEDIS load; it is a massive and complex dataset. Since last fall, the team has been optimizing the process by offloading specific elements to Databricks. This effort explains the recent pauses in processing and is the reason resource spikes have become less extreme. While we estimated the new process would consume 60–75% of historical resources, the actual consumption is slightly lower. However, due to 'data gravity' and the sheer scale of the operation, we must maintain the 6XL compute power to ensure scalability and performance."
