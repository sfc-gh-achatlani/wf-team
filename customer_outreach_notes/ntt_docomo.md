## Notes

### 2025-01-19 | Account Team

**Context**: Weekly outreach on revenue moves

**Move Observed**: DML volatility

**Account Team Response**: "NTT DOCOMO's Snowflake usage growth is driven by Snowpark workloads focused on feature engineering for a system measuring subscriber communication quality, currently deployed in the Tokyo-Yokohama region with plans to scale nationwide by end of 2025. Monthly DML consumption spikes, tied to large-scale ML testing on 4XL warehouses, are expected to continue. Post-July activity depends on budget allocation, with a potential ¥200–300M (~$2M USD) earmarked for continued investment. Extension beyond 2025 will be based on the project's ROI and cost-efficiency evaluation."
