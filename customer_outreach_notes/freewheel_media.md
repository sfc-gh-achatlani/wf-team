## Notes

### 2025-01-19 | Account Team

**Context**: Weekly outreach on revenue moves (DE)

**Move Observed**: Snowpark DE spike

**Account Team Response**: "Spike week before ----- asked; Freewheel also had a spike and then decline at the end of September in Snowpark DE but did not get clear signal from acct team. I spoke with their Director of Data Engineering. He has been doing some roll up testing. This is not going live but he is converting some of their data and doing aggregate rollups into a new data model which will be gradually rolled out over the next couple of quarters."
