## Notes

### 2025-01-19 | Account Team

**Context**: Weekly outreach on revenue moves

**Move Observed**: Back down from spike

**Account Team Response**: "Last week spike caused by Engineering moved their WHs to 16g which caused an unexpected large cost increase. Have moved back to 32g fully as of Tuesday this week and working on a plan to get then move to gen2"

### 2025-01-12 | Account Team

**Context**: Weekly outreach on revenue moves

**Move Observed**: Spike week?, up 87% WoW

**Account Team Response**: "This dip was due to both the holiday and a migration of a large chunk of their accounts back to ARM32 warehouses. I would imagine the impact will be somewhere between a $360k and $400k reduction per month moving forward. Engineering moved their WHs to 16g which caused an unexpected large cost increase. Have moved back to 32g fully as of Tuesday this week and working on a plan to get then move to gen2. However, testing on gen2 has a very similar lower consumption as the 32g chipset. Also they've already started moving some of their extracts to gen2 and also seeing reduction there. Net, pretty significant optimization as a result. Potential warehouse consolidation on the horizon as well."
