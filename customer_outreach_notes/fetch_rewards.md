## Notes

### 2024-10-13 | Account Team

**Context**: Weekly outreach on revenue moves (DE)

**Move Observed**: Data Engineering tools down -24.0%

**Account Team Response**: "Yes, the Search Optimization spike was isolated to 10/3 & 10/4. We have been monitoring closely. Fetch saw a fairly large increase overall in the month of September, we are seeing the downward trend in October to mirror similar DE patterns prior to Sept. Generally, we still expect modest increase in consumption MoM as Fetch continues to scale. We are confident this is resetting from an aggressive Sept."

### 2024-10-06 | Account Team

**Context**: Weekly outreach on revenue moves (DE, Analytics)

**Move Observed**: -20.6% W/W, -23% DE tools, -100% Search Optimization refresh (from $13K -> $22)

**Account Team Response**: "search optimization was an accidental spike. they had almost no search optimization, a huge spike, then back down to nothing. We haven't gotten clarity on what happened there, but we alerted them when we saw the huge jump in search optimization. snowpipe consumption is down, as they were moving to a different snowpipe connector, we expect that to be lower going forward. Data unloads are down. they were doing experimentation with data extracts to clickhouse for low latency analytics. we didn't win that workload due to interactive tables not being ready yet, but they still consumed lots of credits doing data extracts from snowflake to test in clickhouse. now they're closer to production so we expect those extracts to continue but at a lower level. I was looking at their consumption earlier this week, and didn't see any other smoking guns. the last 2-3 weeks were abnormally high, but last week still appears to be lower than normal even if those were outlier weeks. but fetch's consumption is historically very uneven."
